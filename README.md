# **Project Description**: 

what is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create.

# **Process**: 
We shot the video all together, and we decide to give the work of editing to one person, and website coding to other two members. 

**Movie Editing**

**Starting Page**

The landing page of the website used CSS animations with effect on the line spacing and this was done on the title text which was the name of the movie - “Dorm store”. There is a button on the landing page that will redirect you to the home page. 


**Home Page**

For the home page, we have an accordion-like menu of options. We wanted to test around with different types of layout and this looked like a really cool option. The menu options, when clicked on, will expand to reveal more information. 

For the financial statements, film, and gallery, we used modal windows. So, when clicking on the button, you won’t be redirected to a new page, but rather new content will show up on the present page itself and there’s an option to close the window to reveal the original home page. We used Jquery for this where the display was toggled between ‘block’ and ‘hidden’ according to the buttons pressed by the user. 

To keep with the theme, the background image for both the landing and home page is a poster that’s used in the film, and a filter of grey color is applied to it for the legibility of text.

**About Us**

The ‘About Us’ page takes you to the Github page of the website. 

**Gallery**

The gallery used a CSS animation effect too, when you hover over the images, the images would slowly zoom in, but it gives the effect of water ripples. And there are thick border lines in the gallery with orange color to keep with the palette of the home page. The word ‘Gallery’ is written in vertical alignment to keep in theme with the aesthetics of the gallery page.

# **Reflection/Evaluation**: 

This project was so much fun to work on for all of us. The shooting fo the film sequences were very enjoyable as well as a good learning experince for us in using film equipment. We had a solid storyline set from the beginning which made the shooting and editing a bit more of a smoother process. For the website, we worked on different ways to present the information like using accordian-like menu, putting in CSS animations as well as using modal windows. Since we divided the task of editing and coding among ourselves, it was easy for us to do our parts without worrying about the others. And integrating all of it was easy too! In a nutshell, telling mike's success story through film was a great experience for us!
